## Hi there,

I'm currently working on [Readsmart](https://readsmart.co) and [The Product Index](https://theproductindex.com). Before that, started my startup with former colleagues in the logistics industry.

I got into Product Management after realizing that customers care about their problems, not the solution. That's when my mind shifted to a *product mindset*. I enjoy understanding exactly what their needs are.

During my time as a student, I joined a small startup called [Olapic](https://olapic.com) as a software engineer. My role evolved to building and leading *Data Infrastructure*, *Business Intelligence*, and *Analytics Product* teams from the ground up. Many of the responsibilities of a Product Manager were in my plate before fully transition to the role, including the strategic direction and tactical delivery of these teams. 

From day one, I’ve been responsible for every product decision around data. As an early employee, I've been fortunate to be part of incredible growth and a successful acquisition.

As a Product Manager, I owned and launched several products. Some of them more client-facing like dashboard redesigns, tailored reporting, and enterprise support. Others more technical like integration, global support features, and major infrastructure improvements.

Outside work, I love to invest time in self-improvement. Physically, by working-out and doing mobility routines. Mentally, by reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74645368-david-fern-ndez), listening to [podcasts/music](spotify:user:fernandezdavid7), and practicing meditation. I'm also into the practice of [commonplacing](https://medium.com/read-smart/why-you-should-consider-a-digital-commonplace-book-dd8748215ccb).

I’m a big fan of building systems and habits for personal growth. Discipline and consistency are essential [values](/values.md) for me.
