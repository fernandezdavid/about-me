## Hi there,

I'm currently working on [Readsmart](https://readsmart.co) and [The Product Index](https://theproductindex.com). Before that, I started Falcon Trail, a startup to make the process of moving goods easy and efficient in the logistics industry.

I got into Product Management after realizing that customers care more about their problems than your solution. My mind then, shifted to a *product mindset* since my days as a developer. I enjoy understanding exactly what their needs are.

During my time at the university, I joined a small startup called [Olapic](https://olapic.com) as a software engineer. Over time my role evolved to leading *Data Infrastructure*, *Business Intelligence*, and *Analytics Product* teams that I personally hired. Many of the responsibilities of a Product Manager were in my plate before fully transition to the role, including the strategic direction, tactical delivery and cross-functional collaboration of these teams.

As a Product Manager, I owned and launched several products. Some of them more client-facing like dashboard redesigns, tailored reporting, and enterprise support. Others more technical like third-party integrations, global support features, and major infrastructure improvements.

As an early employee, I've been fortunate to be part of incredible growth and one of NYC's [largest tech exits](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/monotype-acquires-olapic/). In this fast-paced and *multi-hat-wearing* environment is where I thrive.

Outside work, I love to invest time in self-improvement. Physically, by working-out and doing mobility routines. Mentally, by reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74645368-david-fern-ndez), listening to [podcasts/music](spotify:user:fernandezdavid7), and practicing meditation. I'm also into the practice of [commonplacing](https://medium.com/read-smart/why-you-should-consider-a-digital-commonplace-book-dd8748215ccb).

Iâ€™m a big fan of building systems and habits for personal growth. Discipline and consistency are essential [values](values) for me.
