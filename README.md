## Hi there,

I'm currently working as *Lead Product Manager* at [Yerbo](https://), a startup looking to help middle managers to become better leaders and prevent burnout. I also love working on side projects like [Readsmart](https://readsmart.co) and [The Product Index](https://theproductindexg.com). Before that, I co-founded Falcon Trail, a logistics startup  startup to make the process of moving goods easy and efficient. You can read about why our product failed on this [Product School guest post](https://www.productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/failed-product-idea-story-mistakes/).

During my time at the University, I joined a small startup called [Olapic](https://olapic.com) as a *Software Engineer*. Over time, my role evolved and ended up creating a Data organization from the ground up as an Engineering Manager. Many of the Product Manager's responsibilities were on my plate before fully transition to the role. That's when I realized, customers care more about their problems than your solution. I've been fortunate to be part of incredible growth on one of the NYC's [largest tech exits](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/monotype-acquires-olapic/). In this fast-paced and *multi-hat-wearing* environment is where I thrive.

When I’m not doing the above, I love to build systems for personal growth. From weightlifting and mobility routines to reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74645368-david-fern-ndez), listening to [podcasts/music](spotify:user:fernandezdavid7), and practicing meditation. I'm also into the practice of [*commonplacing*](https://medium.com/read-smart/why-you-should-consider-a-digital-commonplace-book-dd8748215ccb).

*Determination* and *Discipline* are essential [values](values.md) for me. If there’s one thing you should remember about me is that **I can pick up anything and get the job done**.
