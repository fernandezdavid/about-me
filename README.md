## Hi there!

I'm currently working as *Lead Product Manager* at [Yerbo](https://yerbo.co), a startup behind the [burnoutindex.org](https://burnoutindex.org), looking to humanize relationships at work to raise people's happiness. 

I also love working on side projects like [Readsmart](https://readsmart.co) and [The Product Index](https://theproductindexg.com). Before that, I co-founded Falcon Trail, a logistics startup to make the process of moving goods easy and efficient. You can read about why our product failed on this [Product School guest post](https://www.productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/failed-product-idea-story-mistakes/).

During my time at the university, I joined a small startup called [Olapic](https://olapic.com) as a *Software Engineer*. Over time, my role evolved and ended up creating a Data organization from the ground up as an Engineering Manager. Many of the Product Manager's responsibilities were on my plate before fully transition to the role. I've been fortunate to be part of incredible growth in one of NYC's [largest tech exits](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/monotype-acquires-olapic/). In this fast-paced and *multi-hat-wearing* environment is where I thrive.

When I’m not doing the above, I love building systems to become a better human being. From weightlifting and mobility routines to reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74645368-david-fern-ndez), listening to [podcasts/music](spotify:user:fernandezdavid7), and practicing meditation. I've been practicing the art of [*commonplacing*](https://medium.com/read-smart/why-you-should-consider-a-digital-commonplace-book-dd8748215ccb) too.

*Determination* and *Discipline* are essential [values](values.md) for me. If there’s one thing you should remember about me is that **I can pick up anything and get the job done**.
