# My Toptal Cover Letter

*This blog post is an application supplement based on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/platform/talent/application_info/edit#admission_post=1) recommendation for [Technical Product Managers](https://www.toptal.com/product-managers/technical-product-managers).*

I'm David Fernandez and I live in Cordoba, Argentina. I have a bachelor degree in Software Engineering from UTN University. I started to freelance and work on side projects long before getting my degree. One of them got very popular with more than 12MM monthly active users. I was a local Netflix called [Cuevana](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuevana).

Then, I started at [Olapic](https://www.olapic.com) as an analytics developer, working with high volumes of data. Olapic was a fast-paced startup back then with less than 20 people. Since then, I wore many hats during the process of creating the entire Data organization. From team lead and scrum master to engineering manager and product manager. That's how Data Infrastructure, Business Intelligence, and Analytics Product teams were born.

As Engineer Manager, I was taking on many of the responsibilities of a Product Manager working with Marketing, Customer Success and Sales teams. Working with the CTO on product strategy and creating roadmaps to deliver on the vision. Coordination, planning and ruthless prioritization where day-to-day activities. Communication, in particular, was also critical. Language, timezone, and culture had a huge impact on working with a remote office in NY and later on, in London. Sometimes, it is easier to blame poor communication when conflicts arise while working remotely. Unfortunately, it is often a symptom of a bigger problem.

I believe that remote work and long-lasting relationships are possible. I keep many of them with former colleagues. Although current tools have still room for improvement, those who are truly commitment are thriving.

During my role as Product Manager, I owned and launched several products end-to-end. Some of them client-facing like a complete redesign of the analytics dashboard and Email Reporting feature. Others more technical like Google Analytics integration and infrastructure improvements. However, as an engineering lead, I've been involved in every product decision related to Analytics and Data.

After Olapic, I decided to start a company called Falcon Trail in the logistics industry with former coworkers. The goal was to help shippers connect with carriers to make the process of moving goods easy and efficient. We didn‚Äôt know back then the importance of logistics in any economy but we saw a huge opportunity in such an old-fashioned industry.

During this time, I was in charge of managing the product including marketing and sales. I learned that marketing and selling a product is as challenging as building the right product. I also learned the challenges of getting into an industry as an outsider, especially in an emerging country. From market research, surveys and interviews to MVP definitions and business development, we built 5 different versions of the product and got 6 logistics companies on private beta.

> The most valuable lesson for me was to start within your own industry if you are going to be in charge of getting the clients. It is so much harder than it sounds.

From these experiences, I developed many transferable skills. I am very used to wear many hats and getting things done under pressure and uncertainty. I'm comfortable working with limited resources too. Communication, leadership, product strategy, planning, and prioritization are now part of my toolbox.

When I'm not working, I love to learn or practice a new skill usually through side projects. [The Product Index](https://theproductindex.com) is a curated directory of the best pieces about Product Management. I wanted to learn how to write and this project is perfect for that. [Readsmart](https://readsmart.co) is a tool to manage and revisit all your Kindle highlights. I wanted to actually do something useful with my highlights and notes since I love reading. Now, I'm building an MVP to address the problem of poor posture in knowledge workers.

Furthermore, I love to invest time in self-improvement of mind and body. I‚Äôm a big fan of building systems and habits for personal growth. From working out and doing mobility routines to reading, listening (podcast or music) and meditation. Discipline and consistency are essential to me.

I can honestly say that I didn't have a clue about how to do many of the things I've done so far. I'm always stretching myself. That's who I am.

**If there‚Äôs only one thing you should remember about me is that I can pick up anything and get the job done**.
